        <ul>
            <li><b>97th Civil Affairs Battalion Digitization.</b> As the HHC Commander, I led a strategic planning process to develop and implement a Headquarters Digitization Strategy. By conducting stakeholder engagement, my planning team determined that protected and predictable customer service hours, a repository of templates, a comprehensive training plan, and ongoing communication to improve prioritization were key changes that needed to accompany the digitization process in order to be successful.  Using the USASOC Knowledge Management Program of Record, Sharepoint, we trained all staff sections and users at the appropriate levels to design and use portal applications, libraries, and web pages to effectively maintain records, version control, share information, process work orders, and staff administrative packets. Examples of staff processes, products, and procedures that were digitized included: S1-personnel actions; S2-security management, S3-Briefings, training management, orders; S4: property book management, GPC requests, contract management, logistical support, S6-work order management, Maintenance-maintenance requests, Class IX, Supply-supply requests.</li>
            <li>Set up and maintained the Commanderâ€™s Initiatives Group Portal Site</li>
