        <h2> About Me </h2>

        <h3>  
            <p>Over the past 13 years of military service, I have served in various key developmental leadership positions in the Army at multiple echelons to include the platoon, company, battalion, and division level.  I have also had the opportunity to perform three distinct branch functions (Engineers, Military Police, Civil Affairs), serve in Conventional and Special Operations units, and work in both the operating and generating force.  I believe these various experiences provide me with a unique perspective and understanding on the commonalities and differences of distinct stakeholders as well as how these capabilities integrate, both in theory and in practice. 
            </p>
            <p>
            As an individual, I have always been intellectually curious, driven, systems-focused, and analytical in all aspects of my life. I want to join the Emerging Technology Program because I want to solve problems with tangible results and modern solutions. Too many times, I have been frustrated by the Army’s archaic, disparate, and non-user-friendly systems and processes that require manual and redundant inputs.  My efforts to improve such systems have been limited to what I can affect and highly contingent upon the support and attention of my commanders.  I hope to apply my diverse set of experiences and skillsets to work with other talented and motivated individuals to improve the status quo on a much larger scale. I want to be a part of a governance solution that harnesses technology and existing commercial software tools to make Soldiers, leaders, and commanders’ lives easier and more productive so that they can focus on more important warfighting functions rather than on administration.  I have always had a strong interest in software development and data science, but I have not had the ability to pursue these interests seriously. The Emerging Technology Program would provide me the invaluable opportunity, venue, and time to formally develop and apply the requisite skills full-time without distractions and competing responsibilities.
